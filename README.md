# rs.ui
rs.ui modifies RStudio files such that they point to css files rs.ui generates. Doing this allows the UI of RStudio to be customized. 
rs.ui backs up the un-modded RStudio files such that the original RStudio setup can be restored.

Here's an example of a normal-dark mode RStudio theme, wherein the borders are always a blue-ish color:

With rs.ui, you can have something like this in seconds:

## Usage
rs.ui can be installed with the following command:
```
devtools::install_github("grcatlin/rs.ui")
```

The basic flow of rs.ui is to call `rs.ui()`, then reboot or reload RStudio.
```
library(rs.ui)
rs.ui(main_color = "#205d89")
```
**Notice only the editor is modified at this point, you need to restart RStudio or reload it from here.**

From here, you will only need to use the rs.ui library again if you want to change the theme or restore RStudio!

## Exact Theme or Theme Generation? Both!

### main_color
If provided a main_color, rs.ui generates a custom theme based off this color
by calculating tints/shades and analogous colors. If rs.ui generates a theme you enjoy,
it can be exported with the export parameter so it can be shared!

### theme_def
If provided a valid theme_def, no generation takes place and rs.ui writes
css files according to the provided theme_def. This option was added to allow
finer control and sharing between rs.ui users.

## Examples

`rs.ui(main_color = "#504066")`

```
my_theme = read.csv("theme.csv")
rs.ui(theme_def = my_theme)
```

## Caveats
At the moment, only MacOS is supported but it is possible to do the same on Windows and/or Linux.
